# About

<!--author-->

## Who am I?

I'm a User Experience (UX) Designer, aquarium diver, occasional voice talent, pretend developer, media producer, faux marine biologist, and generally just someone with too much tech.

**More seriously** I spend a lot of time experimenting with a wide variety of hardware and software and I'm also one of the last people to remember dial-up internet. I've been publishing stuff on the internet since the pure HTML days and this is my latest effort to collect and share stuff I find interesting because I suspect others might feel the same way!

## Life Stack

**This website** is built using Netlify, Jekyll, the Hydejack theme, Visual Studio Code, and Namecheap.

**My computing stack** is primarily a whitebox desktop with several LG panels, a Supermicro 4U server chassis running Unraid, an Intel NUC running Home Assistant, a Unifi Dream Machine SE \(and a bunch of other Unifi equipment\), a personal ThinkBook laptop \(which is cheap and cheerful\), a work-provided HP Zbook \(which is... fine\), a Pixel 6 Pro, an iPad Air, and probably a M1 MacBook Pro of some flavor soon.

**My software stack** focuses around the Adobe suite and Visual Studio Code. I don't have a strong OS preference but mostly live in Windows and Linux at the moment.

**My audio equipment** includes a Shure SM7B, Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP, a Rodecaster Pro, Beyerdynamic DT 770 and 990 Pros \(250 ohm\), and JBL 305P MKII studio monitors, among other on-the-go audio gear.

**My camera equipment** includes a Sony a7III, Panasonic G85, OBSBOT Tiny 4K, the Mavic Air 2, an increasing collection of film cameras that I don't currently use, and of course my Pixel 6 Pro.
